     To make Masala Chicken, first thoroughly wash the chicken under running water. Now put it in some warm salted water and allow it to rest for 10 minutes and throw the water away and wash again. This helps to remove the smell of the chicken.Add oil and ghee in pan and heat over medium flame. When the oil is hot enough, add bay leaves and both the cardamom and cinnamon. Saute for a minute and then add finely chopped onion into it. Cook till onions turn pink. Then add the ginger-garlic paste. Fry for a minute and then add chicken pieces in it. Cook chicken for 2-3 minutes until it turns white.Quickly, add red chilli powder, coriander powder, turmeric, cumin powder, and salt to taste. Stir to mix all the ingredients well with the chicken. Cook for a minute and then add finely chopped tomatoes and green chillies (slit and halved). Now reduce the flame and cook covered for 6-7 minutes and then uncovered till the chicken is browned.Add one cup water and cover the pan with a lid and cook for 2-4 minutes until the chicken is tender and soft. Remove the lid and garnish with garam masala powder, coriander leaves, kasoori methi powder and cook on high flame till the oil separates. Your Masala Chicken or Chicken Masala is ready. Enjoy with butter naan, rice or roti.
